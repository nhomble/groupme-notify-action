[.lead]
a github action to send groupme messages

toc::[]

== Examples
This action supports two styles of messaging.

1. You can create a link:https://dev.groupme.com/bots[bot] associated with that group and just invoke the bot apis with your token and botId.
2. Directly with the GroupMe groupId and your access token, you can message a group with your identity.

We recommend you go with option (1) since you'll typically receive notifications on your GroupMe client from a bot but not from yourself.

=== Message with a bot

[source,yml]
----
name: groupme-notify
on: [push]

jobs:
  groupme:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: notify
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: do notification
        uses: nhomble/groupme-notify-action@v1
        id: notification
        with:
          group: ${{ secrets.YOUR_GROUP_ID }}
          message: 'Test notification!'
          token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_API_KEY }}
----

**Note**: you can define both the `group` and `bot` parameter in your yml. This action will give precedence to the **bot mode** so
that `group` parameter will be ignored.

== GroupMe Specifics
You will want to visit https://dev.groupme.com/docs/v3[GroupMe API] for exhaustive documentation.

=== How do I create a bot?
Through the link:https://dev.groupme.com/bots[GroupMe Dev] portal, you can click the **Create Bot** button. From the UI, the **Bot ID** parameter
is what you need to pass to this action.

=== What is the groupId?
1. Get your access token (and keep it a secret!)
2. Get the groupId

Given your access token, you can get a list of all the groups you are a part of by doing:
[source,bash]
----
$ TOKEN=<from above>
$ curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://api.groupme.com/v3/groups?token=$TOKEN
----

What you care about is:
[source,json]
----
{
  "response": [
    {"id":  "<this id>", "name": "GitHub", "...":  "..."},
    {"id":  "123456", "name": "Family", "...":  "..."},
    {"id":  "789023", "name": "Friends", "...":  "..."}
  ]
}
----

Based off of the name, figure out the groupId you want to use and then put that into your `action.yml`.
